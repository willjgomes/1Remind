### Developer Notes

This uses the NPM google clasp module to push files to Google AppScript (GAS). The tree structure is flattened when pushed.

Development is done using Visual Studio Code. For syntax highlighting the Vue, Vutor and E6 HTML String plugins are used.
As result of E6 HTML string plugin, some fo the JS files includes a /* html */ comment to activate the syntax higlighting.
