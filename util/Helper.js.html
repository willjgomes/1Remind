 * reference map.

 * This approach is needed to store our own refrences to the elements when using 
 * Composition API. (Note: With the Options API there is a simpler way to store and
 * acess the refs). The ref is being used so we can scroll to a newly added element 
 * (eg. event v-card) for visual feedback after a creating/saving a new event-item
